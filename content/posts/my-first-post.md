This is my very first post using Hugo!

## Emoji Support
This is enable by going into the the `config.toml` file and adding the following line.

```
enableEmoji = true
```

I :heart: Hugo!

## LaTeX Equation through MathJax
The official Hugo documentation goes over how you can [setup MathJax with Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#mathjax-with-hugo).

However, this [particular blog post](https://divadnojnarg.github.io/blog/mathjax/) from a fellow Hugo user is arguably clearer and easier to follow if you want to setup MathJax support for your own Hugo site.

### Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

$$ \left( \sum\_{k=1}^n a\_k b\_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum\_{k=1}^n a\_k^2 \right) \left( \sum\_{k=1}^n b\_k^2 \right) $$

### Probability of getting \\(k\\) heads when flipping \\(n\\) coins is

$$ P(E) = {n \choose k} p^k (1-p)^{ n-k} $$

Making a small change on Github desktop!
